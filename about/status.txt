Notes about the project status, until next release.


******************
This is a proposal
******************

Although applied on private or small projects, this style guide should be
considered as a draft. It is not industry standard and have not been supported
by some "big" projects.

However, you can already use it or provide feedback!

Status would change if, as examples:

* additional users give feedback, i.e. if the project is not used by only its
  author ;)

* additional contributors join the project, which should be equivalent to the
  previous point.

* another project replaces this one.


********
Planning
********

* Use the style guide in some projects managed by authors, contributors and
  early adopters.
* Communicate and get feedback. Propose it to some visible projects such as:

  * `Read the docs`_
  * `Sphinx`_
  * `Python`_
  * `Lettuce`_

* Depending on the feedback and contributions, reconsider this project's
  relevance, adapt goals and planning.
